- 👋 Hello, I'm @JPZIERRR Hello, or rather João Pedro Martins Fornazier, I'm 18 years old and I live in Uberlândia-MG. I found out about the program last year through a YouTube video and I identified with it. At the time, I was finishing school and didn't know what I was going to do, until I saw this video, which opened the doors of programming for me. Since then I study fullstack development daily through several courses.
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack development, in the short term I want to focus more on web development, from creating websites, virtual stores, e-commerces, blogs anyway... In the long term I plan to focus on mobile and developing apps in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning backend in nodeJs and express, as well as relational (mySQL) and non-relational (noSQL) databases. I already have strong knowledge in front-end with, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJs and NextJs, in addition to having basic knowledge in Wordpress, mariaDB, strapi and postgreeSQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that is the creation of a website for a new production company, this website will contain an advanced design and high interactivity with the user who accesses it, it is a very challenging project, but very interesting to be carried out.
